Prophet Ibrahim ؑ, known as the "Friend of Allah" (Khalil Allah), is one of the most revered prophets in Islam. He is considered the father of monotheism and the ancestor of many prophets, including Muhammad ﷺ.

## Early Life and Call to Monotheism

Ibrahim ؑ was born in Ur (modern-day Iraq) during a time when idol worship was widespread. From a young age, he questioned the practice of worshipping idols and sought the truth about the Creator.

## Challenging Idol Worship

One of the most famous incidents in Ibrahim's ؑ life was when he destroyed the idols in his father's workshop, leaving only the largest one. When questioned, he said the big idol had destroyed the others, demonstrating their powerlessness to his people.

## The Test of Fire

When Ibrahim ؑ refused to stop preaching monotheism, his people decided to burn him alive. Allah commanded the fire to be cool and safe for Ibrahim ؑ, saving him from harm and demonstrating Allah's power.

## Building the Kaaba

Allah commanded Ibrahim ؑ and his son Ismail ؑ to build the Kaaba in Mecca. This sacred structure became the focal point for Islamic worship and pilgrimage, with millions of Muslims visiting it annually for Hajj.

## The Ultimate Test

The greatest test of Ibrahim's ؑ faith came when Allah commanded him to sacrifice his beloved son Ismail ؑ. Both father and son submitted to Allah's will, but at the crucial moment, Allah provided a ram as a substitute, teaching that absolute obedience to Allah is what matters most.

## Legacy

Ibrahim ؑ established the foundation of monotheistic faith that would be continued through his descendants. His prayers for guidance and his example of submission to Allah continue to inspire believers today.
