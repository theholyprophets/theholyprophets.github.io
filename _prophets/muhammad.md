Muhammad ibn Abdullah ﷺ, known as the Seal of the Prophets, was born in Mecca in 571 CE. He received his first revelation at the age of 40 in the Cave of Hira, marking the beginning of his prophetic mission that would transform the Arabian Peninsula and eventually the world.

## Early Life

Before his prophetic calling, Muhammad ﷺ was known among his people as "Al-Amin" (the Trustworthy) due to his honesty and integrity. He worked as a merchant and was married to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, who became the first person to believe in his message.

## The Call to Prophethood

The angel Jibril (Gabriel) appeared to Muhammad ﷺ in the Cave of Hira with the first verses of the Quran: "Read! In the name of your Lord who created..." This marked the beginning of 23 years of divine revelation that would comprise the final scripture, the Quran.

## The Message

Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ message centered on the oneness of Allah (Tawhid), social justice, and moral reformation. He preached against the idol worship prevalent in Arabian society and called people to worship Allah alone.

## Migration to Medina

Facing persecution in Mecca, the Prophet ﷺ and his followers migrated to Medina in 622 CE. This event, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar and was pivotal in establishing the first Muslim community.

## Legacy

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ passed away in 632 CE, leaving behind a unified Arabian Peninsula under Islam and a community that would continue to spread his message across the world. His teachings, preserved in the Quran and Hadith, continue to guide over 1.8 billion Muslims today.
